"# TRAINING-OF-LSTM-RNN-MODEL-WITH-HELP-OF-GENETIC-ALGORITHMS" 
The project proposes a methodology of training the recurrent neural networks with genetic algorithm. The recurrent neural networks are built using LSTM cells rather than the backpropagation technique. Genetic algorithms are used for training the recurrent neural networks. This algorithm helps in obtaining a suitable architecture for the deep networks. In this project, genetic algorithm helps to adjust the appropriate number of LSTM units and the window size of the unit.
